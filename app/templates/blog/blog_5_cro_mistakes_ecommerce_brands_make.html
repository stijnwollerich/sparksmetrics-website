      <h2 id="mistake-1">Mistake #1: Skipping qualitative research</h2>
      <p>Analytics show where users drop off; qualitative research shows why. Without short surveys, session recordings, or 1:1 interviews, teams guess at motivations and design tests that miss the root cause.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: Quantitative metrics tell you "what" but not "why." Qualitative signals expose friction, trust issues, and confusing copy that data alone cannot reveal.</p>
      <p>Start with a 1‑question micro‑survey on the page you care about (PDP, checkout). Ask: “What’s stopping you from buying today?” Gather 30–100 responses, group themes, and convert each into a hypothesis.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> deploy a micro‑survey (5–10 min), review 30 recordings (2–4 hours), extract top objections, and draft hypotheses. Example hypothesis: "If we add explicit shipping timing above the CTA, purchase completion will increase by reducing uncertainty."</p>

      <h2 id="mistake-2">Mistake #2: Treating quantitative data as the whole story</h2>
      <p>GA4 funnels and heatmaps are essential but incomplete. They point to the problem area; qualitative signals and segmentation explain the cause. A single aggregate drop can hide device or channel‑specific issues.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: Aggregated metrics can disguise critical differences — a desktop uplift might hide a mobile crash that costs you more revenue overall.</p>
      <p>Combine segmentation (device, channel, landing page) with survey findings. For example, a mobile drop may indicate layout issues while desktop drop signals performance or checkout complexity.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> segment your funnel, cross‑reference with survey quotes, and create targeted hypotheses per segment. Example: Create a mobile-only variant that simplifies the PDP and measure add-to-cart rate separately.</p>

      <h2 id="mistake-3">Mistake #3: Prioritizing tests ineffectively</h2>
      <p>Prioritization is how you allocate scarce development time. Frameworks (ICE, RICE, PXL) help, but anchor scores in data: traffic, revenue opportunity, and confidence from research.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: Doing lots of low-impact tests wastes engineering capacity and delays high-value wins. Prioritization ensures continuous learning while targeting revenue upside.</p>
      <p>Run a balanced pipeline: 1 higher‑impact experiment and 2–3 quick wins per sprint. This keeps learning continuous while pursuing big upside.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> create an ICE spreadsheet, estimate effort in dev hours, and schedule non‑conflicting tests. Example prioritization: score each hypothesis by expected revenue impact × confidence (from research) ÷ effort hours.</p>

      <h2 id="mistake-4">Mistake #4: Weak copy that doesn't convert</h2>
      <p>Copy is the interface between product and buyer. Vague, brand‑first language loses conversions. Use benefit statements, concise value stacks, and answer the top three buyer questions above the fold.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: Clear, benefit-led copy reduces hesitation and increases intent. Small headline wins can compound into large revenue improvements when applied to high-traffic pages.</p>
      <p>Test headline variants and a short FAQ addressing the top objections found in your qualitative research.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> run 3 headline A/Bs, add one-line value stack, and surface the top 3 objections near CTA. Example copy test: Control vs "Free 30‑day returns + same‑day dispatch" on PDP.</p>

      <h2 id="mistake-5">Mistake #5: Choosing the wrong test scope (big vs incremental)</h2>
      <p>Big redesigns are costly and risky; incremental tests compound. If fundamentals (research, measurement) are missing, validate direction with small tests first, then scale to a redesign.</p>
      <p>Why this matters: Incremental tests produce rapid learning at low cost. When multiple micro‑wins point the same direction, a redesign becomes a lower-risk, higher-confidence investment.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick actions:</strong> run 4–6 micro‑tests to validate hypotheses before committing to large engineering efforts. Example sequence: copy tweaks → CTA prominence → trust signals → pricing presentation.</p>

        <h3>Implementation checklist</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Deploy a 1‑question micro‑survey on the target page (5–10 min)</li>
          <li>Review 30 session recordings and tag friction (2–4 hours)</li>
          <li>Prioritize ideas with ICE/RICE and pick 2 quick wins for next sprint (1–2 hours)</li>
          <li>Run headline + CTA tests and measure revenue‑per‑visitor (1–3 days)</li>
          <li>Plan a testing calendar to avoid overlapping experiments (1 day)</li>
          <li>Document each experiment with hypothesis, measurement, and outcome (ongoing)</li>
          <li>Deliver experiment exports and variant URLs to a shared repository monthly</li>

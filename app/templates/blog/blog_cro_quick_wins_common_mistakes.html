      <p class="lead">
        This article is written for e‑commerce founders, growth leads, and
        marketing directors who need a quick, evidence-driven checklist to vet
        CRO partners. For each red flag we include what to ask, a short
        verification test, and the likely business impact if left unchecked.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best agencies make your business measurably more money. The worst
        ones quietly waste your time and budget. Below are the ten red flags we
        hear about most often — each paired with a practical check you can run
        before you sign a contract.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-1">1. Vanity‑metric obsession</h2>
      <p>
        Beware agencies that optimize for surface metrics: conversion rate, CTR,
        product view rate. Those metrics matter only to the degree they move
        revenue per visitor or lifetime value. A test that reduces conversion
        rate but increases average order value (AOV) can be a huge net win —
        don’t reject it because a single metric looks worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Optimizing the wrong metric can create short-term wins
        at the expense of long-term revenue. For example, aggressive discounting
        can lift conversion rate while destroying margin and teaching customers
        to buy only on sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Red flag test: ask the agency to show a recent test where conversion
        rate dropped but revenue per visitor improved. If they can’t produce an
        example, they may be over-focused on narrow KPIs. Quick action: request
        experiment exports that show revenue per visitor, AOV, and per-session
        revenue for each variant.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-2">2. Guaranteed results</h2>
      <p>
        No reputable CRO agency can guarantee a specific % uplift. CRO is
        probabilistic: you can guarantee you’ll run tests and improve the
        probability of wins, but external factors (seasonality, traffic mix, ad
        spend) change outcomes after a test goes live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Promises of fixed uplifts often hide a lack of
        process. Guarantees remove accountability for measurement and can push
        agencies to game reporting rather than improve customer value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contract tip: require guarantees around process (number of tests, access
        to data, knowledge transfer), not percent increases. If an agency
        promises a fixed uplift, ask them to back it with a refund policy tied
        to documented, reproducible outcomes. Quick action: require a sample
        data export and a written test plan for the first 4 tests.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-3">3. Vague claims without proof</h2>
      <p>
        If the agency says “performance is better” but can’t show the AB test,
        confidence interval, or raw experiment data, walk away. Every claim
        should map to a test with a winner, a confidence level, and a clear
        measurement window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Without raw data you can't verify results or learn
        from failures. Good agencies share experiment exports, variant URLs, and
        analysis notes so your internal team can reproduce results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verification step: insist on read‑only access to the A/B tool (or copies
        of experiment exports). Check how they calculate significance and
        whether they account for peeking, segmentation, and false positives.
        Quick action: ask for two recent experiment exports and the raw metrics
        they used to calculate the winner.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-4">4. Design first, data later</h2>
      <p>
        Design-driven approaches look pretty, but they’re guesses until proven
        by data. A redesign without hypothesis testing wastes time and money.
        CRO should start with analytics and qualitative research to form
        testable hypotheses, then design and implement experiments to validate
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: A full redesign can take months and may reduce
        conversions if the underlying user problems weren't diagnosed. Start
        with diagnostic tests and narrow experiments to validate direction
        before scaling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring tip: ask the agency to show their research → hypothesis → test →
        learn pipeline. If they demo designs without hypotheses, they’re likely
        building for vanity, not impact. Quick action: request an example
        research doc and the corresponding experiment that validated (or
        invalidated) the proposed change.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-5">5. Cheap, short‑term tests only</h2>
      <p>
        Discounts and coupons convert — but they erode margins and train
        customers to expect cheap prices. Agencies that rely only on promotional
        hacks may deliver short wins but no sustainable growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Short-term fixes can mask product-market mismatches
        and reduce brand value. Look for agencies that combine quick wins with
        longer-term experiments focused on AOV and retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assessment: request long‑term initiatives (LTV experiments) and examples
        of tests that improved retention or average order value without
        discounting. If the portfolio is all coupon wins, be cautious. Quick
        action: ask for a 6‑month test plan that includes at least one retention
        or pricing experiment.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-6">6. Not a team player</h2>
      <p>
        CRO is cross‑functional: product, design, analytics, engineering, and
        marketing all need to collaborate. Agencies that expect you to hand over
        everything and disappear are a liability. Good agencies embed with
        teams, respect brand boundaries, and have clear handoffs for
        implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Poor collaboration leads to slow implementation and
        missed learnings. Check who will own experiment implementation, QA, and
        measurement on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operational check: confirm the agency’s expected roles and
        responsibilities, and ensure your internal dev/ops team signs off on
        implementation complexity before work begins. Quick action: request a
        RACI for the first sprint.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-7">7. Lack of business or industry context</h2>
      <p>
        Generic playbooks fail in niche markets. A great agency invests time in
        your industry, competitors, and customer behavior. They ask about
        margins, offline conversions, channel economics, and product lifecycle —
        not just "what do you want to test next?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Without context, tests can optimize for vanity
        outcomes that don't improve profitability. Interview question: ask them
        to identify three industry‑specific risks and one unique opportunity for
        your business in their first week. If they can’t, they haven’t done the
        homework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quick action: ask for a short market scan or competitor test example
        relevant to your niche.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-8">8. Black‑box reporting and lost assets</h2>
      <p>
        You must own your data, experiments, and designs. Agencies that lock
        ownership or provide only PDF summaries create vendor lock‑in and
        destroy learnings when they leave. Transparent reporting, exportable
        test assets, and tooling access are non‑negotiable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: When an agency leaves, you should retain the playbook
        and experiments. Ask for monthly exports, variant URLs, analytics
        queries, and design files in a shared repo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contract clause: require read‑only access to experiment platforms and
        that all creative, variants, and test documentation be delivered to you
        monthly in a shared repository. Quick action: request a sample monthly
        export and the folder structure you'll receive.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-9">9. Creeping costs and scope confusion</h2>
      <p>
        Testing includes design, dev, QA, and analytics. Unexpected change
        orders are common if scope isn’t clear. Insist on a clear SOW with
        included tasks, per‑unit costs for extras, and an approval gate for
        out‑of‑scope work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Ambiguous scope causes delays and hidden costs.
        Negotiation tip: set a monthly test quota and a budget per sprint.
        Define who pays for third‑party testing tools or creative assets up
        front. Quick action: require a sample SOW and one-month sprint plan as
        part of the proposal.
      </p>

      <h2 id="flag-10">10. Only going for big swings</h2>
      <p>
        Big swings can produce dramatic lifts but are high‑risk and slow. A
        balanced approach — fast micro‑tests to learn + occasional big bets when
        hypotheses are validated — is the smartest path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why this matters: Over-investing in large bets without validated
        learning wastes budget and delays ROI. Strategy: run rapid learning
        cycles (copy, micro‑layout, trust signals) and only scale to redesigns
        after multiple validated insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quick action: ask for an experimental roadmap that sequences micro‑tests
        before any major redesign work.
      </p>
